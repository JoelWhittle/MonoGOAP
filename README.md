# MonoGOAP
An implementation of Goal Oriented Action Planning using MonoGame.  Implements steering behaviours and A* pathfinding for unit navigation.

Characters will fulfill their basic human needs by visiting the correlating building, either to purchase a burger, purchase a drink, or to fullfill the call of nature. Characters will place litter in bins, which will eventually overflow. If a character cant find a nearby bin, they will drop their litter on the spot. 

To counteract the increasing litter problem, a Janitor has been employed to empty the bins and remove the litter.
